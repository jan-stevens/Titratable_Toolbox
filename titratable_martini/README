martini.itp  ->   topology head-file to be included in .top file

it includes:
- charged_beads.itp
- neutral_beads.itp
- titratable_beads_cross.itp
- dummy_beads.itp
- pH_dep_interactions.itp
- titratable_beads_self_proton.itp

molecules.itp -> parameters for small molecules used for titrations, free energies of transfer and membrane affinities
lipids.tip    -> parameters for DPPC, POPC, DOPC martiniv3 lipids
ion.itp       -> parameters for hydrated sodium and chloride
PPI.itp       -> parameters for G5 dendrimer

example.top   -> example topology file matching the example.gro/mdp
example.mdp   -> example run settings file
example.gro   -> example structure file for titratable water with single PVA molecule

18.11.2021  Fabian Grunewald
            -> updated the neutral bead interactions to the most recent release of Martini3
            -> included proto interactions for SQ3p, SQ4p, SQ5n, Q5; at the moment they're NAN
            -> q dummy bead interactions are moved to charged_beads.itp and removed from
               dummy beads
            -> Since the PC headgroups changed from Q5n/Q1p to Q5/Q1 the interactions have been
               renamed and updated
